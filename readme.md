AI-Powered Code Editor for the Command Line

**Overview**

ai-code-editor is a command-line code editor that leverages artificial intelligence to assist developers in writing, debugging, and maintaining their code. With a focus on ease of use and productivity, this tool aims to simplify the coding process by providing real-time suggestions, auto-completion, and intelligent error detection.

**Features**

* Real-time syntax highlighting and code completion
* AI-powered code suggestions for improved readability and maintainability
* Auto-import statement generation for popular libraries and frameworks
* Intelligent error detection and suggestion of potential fixes

**Components**

The ai-code-editor project consists of the following components:

* **ai-code-editor**: The main executable that handles user input, parses code, and generates output.
* **config**: A package containing configuration files and settings for the editor (e.g., theme, language, etc.).
        + `config.go`: Defines the configuration structure and provides methods for reading and writing config data.
* **go.mod**: The Go module file that lists the project's dependencies.
* **main.go**: The entry point of the program that initializes the editor and handles user input.
* **ollama**:
        + `client.go`: Handles communication with the AI engine (not included in this repository) to retrieve code suggestions and insights.

**Services**

The ai-code-editor project also includes a services package containing reusable functions for directory tree manipulation:

* **directory_tree.go**: Provides methods for traversing and manipulating directory trees.

**Getting Started**

To use ai-code-editor, simply clone the repository and run the executable (e.g., `go run main.go`). The editor will prompt you to select a programming language and theme. From there, you can start typing code, and the AI-powered features will be available for use.

**Future Development**

We plan to expand ai-code-editor's capabilities by integrating additional AI models, supporting more programming languages, and improving overall performance. Your feedback and contributions are welcome!
