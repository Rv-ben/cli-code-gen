Given this code context and search query, generate {{$queryCount}} potential file names in an array []. 
Analyze the code to find internal dependencies and generate potential file names for the code snippet you think are relevant to the Original Query.

Guidelines for generating file names:
1. Focus on internal dependencies and related components
2. Consider both direct and indirect relationships
3. Look for files that would contain related functionality
4. Avoid third-party dependencies and focus on project-specific files
5. Consider the architectural patterns and relationships in the code
6. Look for files that would contain complementary or supporting functionality
7. Avoid generic searches

DO NOT INCLUDE THE FILE NAMES YOU WERE GIVEN.
DO NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TEXT JUST THE ARRAY.
DO NOT EXCEED THE COUNT REQUESTED: {{$queryCount}}
Example Output: ["potentialFileName", "potentialFileName"]

Original Query: {{$searchQuery}}
